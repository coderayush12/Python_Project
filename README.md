# Python_Project
This project performs an in-depth analysis of Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) data to understand air pollution patterns and trends over time. Using Python, the dataset is cleaned and explored through exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify periods of high pollution, variations in AQI levels, and the overall behavior of air quality. Visualizations are used extensively to present insights clearly and effectively, helping to interpret real-world environmental data and derive meaningful conclusions.
